When you click on the red <a href="/attend">attend</a> button at the top right corner of our page, you will be offered two options: “Live Event” and “Streaming Event”.

Let us explain how TEDxNYUAD is going to work: According to TEDx regulations, we cannot host more than 100 audience members – these 100 seats will be available by invite only.

These awe-inspiring, sheer ingenuous and empowering talks revolve around the theme of innovation, change and thinking differently. TED has become a global phenomenon because it provides a platform for people to share their ideas and stories. This year, New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD) bring eleven of these inspirational and innovative talks to you.</p><p>This April 2015, NYUAD will be hosting its very first TEDx conference. TEDxNYUAD is going to be a TEDx conference unlike any other. In a university that is still new and building from a blank slate, the student body has such varied and dynamic experiences that go unshared. Within this diverse community, countless students have incredible stories and ideas inspired by their achievements, struggles, aspirations, experiences, interests and passions. However these untold stories and unshared ideas have yet to manifest themselves. TEDxNYUAD aims to provide the opportunity not only for individuals to share their ideas and experiences , but most importantly to give them the chance to move, inspire and truly affect the community of Abu Dhabi and beyond. TEDxNYUAD also hopes to foster an intellectual environment where ideas and innovations are shared and a dynamic dialogue started.</p><p>The university’s first TEDx conference will include speakers from the United Arab Emirates, Brazil, Chile, Ethiopia, India, Montenegro, Ukraine, United Kingdom, Netherlands, and Qatar. But the talks go beyond the boundaries of the speakers’ nations and will relate to and resonate with global issues, individual struggles, socio-political matters and technological advancements.</p><h5>A myriad of stories to be told and ideas to be shared</h5><pThe creative writing instructor Robert McKee said that, “Stories are the creative conversion of life itself into a more powerful, clearer, more meaningful experience. They are the currency of human contact.”</p><p>TEDxNYUAD is not just an opportunity for everyone to engage in an exchange of ideas and experiences, but it will equally be an opportunity for the university to reach out to the local community and the larger region itself!</p><p>We hope that, this April, you will join us at the live event either in person or through video streaming as we unearth the ideas and experiences that make NYUAD what it is today; a university which hosts a diverse and unique body of students that are in the process of finding themselves as well as using the impetus of ideas and innovation to bring about a change in the world around them. Join us for an evening when we not only listen to the unique stories students have to share and be inspired by their novel ideas, but also partake in the spirit of New York University Abu Dhabi.</p><p>Information on the speakers and their topics has been published online with the launch of our new website!</p>'
