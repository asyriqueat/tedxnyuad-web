As the event came closer and closer, the speakers became noticeably more nervous and quieter. The chatter heard during the rehearsal died down.</p><p>TEDxNYUAD officially began. This was the culmination of seven months of preparation and training since November.</p><p>Everyone was nervous. I could tell by the pacing, mumbling, stretching and doing theatre exercises, or being quieter than usual. Of all the speakers, Amer was the most nervous. He could hardly sit still and had freezing hands! To help ease the nerves, I put up inspirational posters and quotes around the room and made power poses with the speakers.</p><p><center><img src="/images/blog/poster.png" width="600px"></center></p><p>We had also set up a TV screen to show the live stream – our way of knowing what was happening on stage. Of course, we were even more curious about those in front of the stage – the audience. I remember us huddling around the TV when an alarm went off during Meera’s speech. The whole room froze and the faces around the room showed disbelief and panic. We were all so impressed by Meera’s collected and graceful response.</p><p><center><img src="/images/blog/greenroom.png" width="600px"></center></p><p>At the same time, my phone was swamped with notifications from messages from the organizing team. While I stayed with the speakers, my wonderful teammates had been running around the building putting the conference and the live streams together. During one of the talks, the live stream went offline and Alf took off from backstage. Within moments, the problem was solved.</p><p><center><img src="/images/blog/offline.png" width="600px"></center></p><p>In the end, the talks proved the hard work to be worth it, as they received huge rounds of applause. As every speaker emerged from the stage excited and relieved, we took turn congratulating him or her. The audience greeted them with similar excitement – some wanted to invite the speakers to their own events. We were able to inspire even the youngest of our audience, as two young girls went up to Hayat and asked for her books!</p><p>After ten hours of nerves and anticipation, a sense of camaraderie had developed within those in the green room. And for me, that was the biggest achievement. TEDxNYUAD was not only a showcase of NYUAD. In developing TEDxNYUAD, we also hoped the speakers were able to gain something, whether it be public speaking skills, ideas worth sharing, or just some new friends.</p><p><b>About Lillian</b></p><p>As part of the TEDxNYU team in New York, I was connected with Ramina when I studied away in NYUAD to start NYUAD’s own TEDx conference. I had the fortune to work closely with the speakers, from the selection process to script-writing workshops. From the initial five-minute pitch to the bulleted outlines to the rehearsed and memorized script, all eleven speakers had refined the best approach to present their ideas.</p><p><center><img src="/images/blog/teamphoto.png" width="600px"></center></p>'

These awe-inspiring, sheer ingenuous and empowering talks revolve around the theme of innovation, change and thinking differently. TED has become a global phenomenon because it provides a platform for people to share their ideas and stories. This year, New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD) bring eleven of these inspirational and innovative talks to you.</p><p>This April 2015, NYUAD will be hosting its very first TEDx conference. TEDxNYUAD is going to be a TEDx conference unlike any other. In a university that is still new and building from a blank slate, the student body has such varied and dynamic experiences that go unshared. Within this diverse community, countless students have incredible stories and ideas inspired by their achievements, struggles, aspirations, experiences, interests and passions. However these untold stories and unshared ideas have yet to manifest themselves. TEDxNYUAD aims to provide the opportunity not only for individuals to share their ideas and experiences , but most importantly to give them the chance to move, inspire and truly affect the community of Abu Dhabi and beyond. TEDxNYUAD also hopes to foster an intellectual environment where ideas and innovations are shared and a dynamic dialogue started.</p><p>The university’s first TEDx conference will include speakers from the United Arab Emirates, Brazil, Chile, Ethiopia, India, Montenegro, Ukraine, United Kingdom, Netherlands, and Qatar. But the talks go beyond the boundaries of the speakers’ nations and will relate to and resonate with global issues, individual struggles, socio-political matters and technological advancements.</p><h5>A myriad of stories to be told and ideas to be shared</h5><pThe creative writing instructor Robert McKee said that, “Stories are the creative conversion of life itself into a more powerful, clearer, more meaningful experience. They are the currency of human contact.”</p><p>TEDxNYUAD is not just an opportunity for everyone to engage in an exchange of ideas and experiences, but it will equally be an opportunity for the university to reach out to the local community and the larger region itself!</p><p>We hope that, this April, you will join us at the live event either in person or through video streaming as we unearth the ideas and experiences that make NYUAD what it is today; a university which hosts a diverse and unique body of students that are in the process of finding themselves as well as using the impetus of ideas and innovation to bring about a change in the world around them. Join us for an evening when we not only listen to the unique stories students have to share and be inspired by their novel ideas, but also partake in the spirit of New York University Abu Dhabi.</p><p>Information on the speakers and their topics has been published online with the launch of our new website!</p>'
