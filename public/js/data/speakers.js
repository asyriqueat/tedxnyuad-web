However, it is the case that some stories are told far more often than others and gradually transform to single narratives and stereotypes. Learning and building common understanding is a gradual and continuous process. We learn through sharing our stories and listening to the stories of others. It is important to continuously provide this space for new stories, new perspectives, and new discussions, which will result in the creation of a more informed, empathetic and respectful society. So the question is, how do we make sure that our voices are heard and that our stories are told the right way?</p>'
